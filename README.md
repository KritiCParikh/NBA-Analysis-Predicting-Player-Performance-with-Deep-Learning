# NBA-Analysis-Predicting-Player-Performance-with-Deep-LearningüèÄ

Welcome to our NBA performance prediction playground! We've combined the magic of deep learning with the thrill of basketball to create a cutting-edge tool for forecasting player scoring output. If you've ever wondered how AI and sports analytics can team up to create game-changing insights, you're in for a treat!

## Project Highlights

- **Six-Model Showdown**: We pit six neural network architectures against each other in an epic battle of predictive prowess. LSTM, MLP, CNN, BiLSTM, GRU, and Transformer - it's like an All-Star game of deep learning models!

- **Data Wizardry**: We wrangled 5,522 rows of NBA player stats from the 2023-2024 season, transforming them into a lean, mean, prediction-ready dataset of 3,910 entries.

- **Feature Alchemy**: We conjured up new features like PointsPerMinute and ShootingEfficiency to give our models that extra edge.

- **Slam Dunk Results**: Our BiLSTM model emerged as the MVP, boasting an impressive R¬≤ score of 0.900. It's like it has eyes in the back of its head!

## Why It's Cool

Ever wondered if a computer could be the next great NBA analyst? We're pushing the boundaries of sports analytics by applying state-of-the-art deep learning techniques to predict player performance. It's not just about the numbers; it's about uncovering the hidden patterns in the beautiful game of basketball.

## Intriguing Insights

- **The Turnover Tango**: We discovered a fascinating 0.80 correlation between points and turnovers. Even the best scorers fumble sometimes!
- **Efficiency Sweet Spot**: Our analysis revealed that better shooters generally score more points, but some mavericks break the mold.
- **Team Size Shuffle**: From Utah's packed roster (~80 players) to leaner lineups (~40 players), we uncovered how teams play their own numbers game.

## Tech Stack

- Python: The Swiss Army knife of data science
- TensorFlow & Keras: Our neural network playground
- Pandas & NumPy: Data wrangling wizards
- Scikit-learn: For that extra ML oomph
- Matplotlib & Seaborn: Turning numbers into eye candy

## üèÜ The MVP (Most Valuable Predictor)

Our BiLSTM model took home the trophy, showcasing an uncanny ability to predict player performance. It even nailed Dante Exum's 4.40 PPG with a jaw-dropping 4.38 prediction!

## What We Learned

Just like a well-executed fast break, our deep learning models showed that with the right combination of statistics and smart algorithms, we can predict player performance with impressive accuracy. Whether you're a coach planning your next game strategy or a fantasy basketball enthusiast looking for that winning edge, these insights prove that in basketball, as in data science, it's all about making the right moves at the right time.
